# parkingFineCalc
Training project

We need to create a simple calculator for this page: https://www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/car-parks-and-parking/parking-regulations-enforcement/pay-pcn.aspx

A fine can be £50 or £70.
If you pay within 14 days of the PRN being issued, you get a 50% discount.
If you do not pay within 56 days, you pay an extra 50%.

Suggested design:
Select input for amount of fine.
Date picker for PRN issue date.
Submit button.
Display area which shows use today's date and what they have to pay if they pay today.

This is a collaborative project - anyone can contribute.
